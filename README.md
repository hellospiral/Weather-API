# Weather API

##### Comparative Weather app using Open Weather API

#### By **Matt Carlson**

## Description

This app allows you to compare the current temperature, humidity, and the average cloudiness over the next five days between two different cities.
I made it to practice using AJAX for pulling in data from an API and inserting it into the DOM.
